                <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,I am Deepshikha from 2nd year Computer Science Department.
                        . As a CSE student, I am learning about various aspects of computer science, including programming, algorithms, data structures, operating systems, computer networks, databases, and software engineering.

 I am building on the foundational knowledge gained in my first year, and delving deeper into these subjects.
I am learning about the various technologies and tools used to create visually appealing and interactive user interfaces for websites and applications. This includes learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the core building blocks of modern web development.
In addition to these foundational languages, I am also exploring popular frontend frameworks such as React.

I am passionate about creating innovative and user-friendly web applications, and I am continually learning and exploring new ways to enhance my skills in this area.
